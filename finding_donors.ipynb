    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",

    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

Logistic regression is intrinsically simple, fast in training and prediction and has low variance and thus less likely to overfit data.\n",
    "Weakness is that it has high bias, as the model is quite simple and so it might not represent the true picture all the time. It also assumes linear relatinship which might be an oversimplification of the case. It also does not learn automatically from feature interactions. There are generally better supervised learning methods than logistic regression. It is a good candidate for our problem as it works well with classifying the data given input features. \n",
    "Another advantage that I missed is that it outputs probailities instead of just simple classification. Probabilities of occurring in a class can give more insight than just a label.\n",
    "2) Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "Desion trees have been used in star-galaxy classification in real world.\n",
    "Decision Tress can be used for numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "- It makes decisions to classify data into target variables based on features in different steps where the data are separated down a decision tree so that information gain is maximum. Top few nodes are where information gain is maximum.\n",
    "An advantage of using this model is that data does not need to be normalized before using the model and missing values also do not prevent the classifier from working. This saves time which would have been used in data prep. Decision trees are also not sensitive to outliers. Another advantage is it can be used in scenarios where data are nonlinearly related. It is fast in training and predicting and performs well with large datasets.\n",
    "Decision trees are highly interpretable, easy to undersatnd and easy to visualize.\n",
    "The main disadvantage is that without proper pruning decision trees tend to overfit training data. They might not work as well as other models like Logistic regression if that is the case. It is not as accurate as other models.\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for our problem as it can classify the target labels effectively and deals well with large datasets in moderatley less time.\n",
    "Desion trees have been used in star-galaxy classification in real world.\n",
    "Another advantage is that decisiontrees can handle missing predictor values (under development in sklearn)\n",
    "3) SVM.\n",
    "Used in classification and prediction of biological data in bioinformatics examples include protein function prediction. Also used in face and speech recognition.\n",
    "Advantages are that they separate the data using hyperplanes that maximize margin (such that distance from data on either side to margin is maximized. They can be used for linearly separable data and data that are not linearly separable. \n",
    "Disadvantage of svm is that it does not perform well on highly skewed data, so they need to be normalized before using svm. SVM is slower than other methods in training and testing data. Aslo not efficient with big numbers of features. It is not suitable for large datasets as it needs to find a separation hyperplane by computing a quadratic function which is complex for large datasets.\n",
    "A disadvantage is that SVM can mainly handle binary classification and not so good at multiple clasification (unless the multiple classes are divited into 2 classes)"

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

The reason for this is that although decisiontree model performs better on training data, Logistic regression has a better score on testing than either SVC or decision tree model. Logistic regression is also fast in training and testing compared to SVC. The algorithm is suitable for classifying dependant categorical data, in our case income>50K and works well with binary classification. Compared to DecisionTree Classifier,, Logistic regression is less likely to overfit data and thus has low variance."

When compared to the naive predictor accuracy scores and f-scores are much better for optimized and unoptimized model. This is to be expected because the naive predictor just predicts 1 value for the whole dataset. We know that only 11,208 out of 45,222 inputs are higher than 50k and the rest are less than 50k. So we can expect the accuracy and f-score of naive predictor to be quite low. F-score is low due to low precision."

I overlooked age on second thought that is pretty relevant since one would expect 30 to 60 year olds with higher income than people in their twenties. I was a little off in ranking which ones were more important than the others. Here capital loss is more important than educ. num factor and this makes sense as people with a big loss, no matter what their education level would make less.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
